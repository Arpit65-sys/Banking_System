## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Simple Banking Application
This Simple Banking Application is a Java project designed for beginners to practice fundamental coding concepts. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.

## Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes the console for user interaction, making it accessible to all users.
Account Management: Users can create new bank accounts and perform transactions seamlessly.
Database Integration: Utilizes MySQL database for storing account details and transaction history.

## Technologies Used:
Java Programming Language
MySQL Database

## Message from my side:
Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the DatabaseManager.java file.
Compile and run the App.java file to start the application.
Feel free to explore and contribute to this simple yet educational project!



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
